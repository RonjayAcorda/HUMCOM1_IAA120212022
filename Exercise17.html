                        The output is "Today is another busy day!". Because after being initialized, a new phrase
                        is being assigned into the same variable before the console.log occurs.

                        The output is still "Today is another busy day!". Because var and let has almost little
                        to no difference. Their only difference is that var tends to be declared globally and let
                        is only declared in a local scope.

                /*d. Replace let with const. Save the html document and refresh the web page. Describe the output. Explain
                        It displays an error because there is an assignment of another content into a constant variable.
